# ExtentionBoardOld
his repository hosts code for a remote extension board control system with ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontrollers. It enables users to toggle switch states through a web interface served locally. Ideal for managing devices within the same WiFi network, ensuring convenience and seamless control of connected appliances.This project enables remote control of an extension board using ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontrollers. Users can toggle the state of switches on the extension board remotely through a web interface served by the microcontroller.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Toggle the state of switches on the extension board remotely via a web interface.
- **Persistent State**: The state of switches is saved to EEPROM, ensuring that the state is maintained across power cycles.
- **Dynamic Web Interface**: Control switches conveniently through a dynamic web interface generated by the microcontroller.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- Extension board with switches or relays
- Internet connection

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Hardware**:
   - Connect the extension board to the microcontroller. Ensure switches or relays are connected to the specified pins in the sketch.
   - Upload the provided sketch (`extension_board_control.ino`) to the microcontroller.

2. **Configure WiFi**:
   - Upon first boot, the microcontroller will create an access point named "PrefectESP". Connect to it using the password "password".
   - Follow the instructions to configure WiFi using the captive portal.

3. **Access Web Interface**:
   - Once connected to WiFi, open a web browser and navigate to the IP address displayed in the Serial Monitor (default port 80).
   - Use the web interface to toggle the switches on the extension board.

4. **Persistent State**:
   - The state of switches is saved to EEPROM, ensuring persistence across power cycles.
